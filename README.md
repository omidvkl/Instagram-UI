# instagram_ui

This repository contains the code for a simplified clone of the Instagram UI using Flutter. It aims to replicate parts of the Instagram app's interface, focusing on the profile view with scrollable tabs to switch between grid and list views of posts.

## Features
- Custom AppBar with Instagram-like styling.
- Profile section with image, post count, followers, and following statistics.
- Editable profile button.
- Scrollable tabs for grid and list post views.
- A grid view of images to mimic the user's gallery.

This project is for educational purposes and demonstrates the use of Flutter widgets to create UI components similar to those found in the Instagram app.

Note: This project does not interact with Instagram's backend, and it doesn't have any functionality to handle real user data.
